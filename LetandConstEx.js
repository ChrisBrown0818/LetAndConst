//Q1. What is the difference between var and let?

//you cannot redeclare let but you can with var.  You can hoist var but you cannot hoist let and let has a block scope, meaning the declared let variable exists within the scope of the block of code.

//Q2.  what is the difference between var and const.
// The same difference as let with var except with const you cannot reassign const.  const's scope is also within the block or the curly braces is wrapped around.

//Q3. What is the difference between let and const?
// You cannot reassign const.

//Q4.
// What is hoisting?
//it refers to the sequence in which code is run.  With a var initialised variable, the variable can be read first within the top of its scope before its even used in the code.
